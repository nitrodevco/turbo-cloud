# Turbo Cloud AI Contract

This file is the canonical coding contract for AI-assisted changes in `turbo-cloud`.
Tool-specific instruction files should reference this file instead of duplicating rules.

## Foundational context
This repository targets the following core stack. When coding, prefer patterns compatible with these versions:
- .NET SDK `9.0.310` (from `global.json`)
- C# / BCL `net9.0`
- Orleans `9.2.1`
- EF Core `9.0.8`
- Pomelo MySQL provider `9.0.0`
- SuperSocket `2.0.2`

## Skills activation
Activate the relevant skill checklist before editing code in that domain:
- `handler-development`
  - Trigger: editing files under `Turbo.PacketHandlers/**` or message-to-composer orchestration logic.
  - Enforce: orchestration-only handlers, no DB queries, canonical grain access, no silent catches.
- `grain-development`
  - Trigger: editing files under `Turbo.*\\Grains\\**` or `Turbo.Primitives/**/Grains/*.cs`.
  - Enforce: keep ownership boundaries, lifecycle rules, and snapshot/state coherence.
- `session-presence-routing`
  - Trigger: touching session gateway, presence flow, room routing, outbound composer fan-out.
  - Enforce: player outbound via `PlayerPresenceGrain.SendComposerAsync`; no direct handler socket sends.
- `message-contracts`
  - Trigger: editing `Turbo.Primitives/Messages/Incoming/**` or outgoing composer payload mappings.
  - Enforce: explicit mandatory fields, no placeholder payloads when source data exists.
- `revision-protocol` (cross-repo)
  - Trigger: changes referencing `Revision<id>` packet mappings.
  - Enforce: edit plugin revision tree in `../turbo-sample-plugin/TurboSamplePlugin/Revision/**`.

## Priority order
1. Build and quality checks in repo files (`Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Build.targets`, `.editorconfig`)
2. `CONTEXT.md` architecture and placement boundaries
3. Existing neighboring code conventions in the target folder
4. Tool-specific adapters (for example `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)

## Portable prompt contract
Use this request shape with any AI tool:
1. Goal:
2. Target files:
3. Required context files:
4. Invariants to preserve:
5. Forbidden changes:
6. Validation commands:
7. Output format:

Default output format:
- concise rationale
- file-by-file diff summary
- risks/assumptions
- exact validation command results

## Required standards
- Target framework/tooling: `.NET 9` pinned via `global.json`.
- Keep C# formatting compatible with repo quality gates (`dotnet csharpier check`, `dotnet format`).
- Follow `.editorconfig` naming/style preferences.
- Keep diffs focused and minimal; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless required by the task.

## Behavioral rules for generated code
- Match local conventions in the files you touch.
- Prefer deterministic handlers/services with clear guard clauses.
- Preserve cancellation and async flow where it already exists.
- Handle failure paths explicitly; do not ship happy-path-only changes.
- Avoid dead code, unused allocations, and broad catch blocks that hide errors.
- For revision compatibility work, prefer restoring/adding missing incoming message contracts in `Turbo.Primitives/Messages/Incoming/**` before mutating serializer/composer payload behavior.
- Do not alter serializer/composer behavior by replacing real payload writes with placeholder constants (for example, unconditional `WriteInteger(0)`) unless explicitly requested.
- If work references `Revision<id>` parsers/serializers, edit the plugin repo path:
  - `../turbo-sample-plugin/TurboSamplePlugin/Revision/**`
  - Do not hallucinate those trees into `turbo-cloud`.

## Profile and grain flow constraints
- Keep packet handlers orchestration-only:
  - validate input
  - call grains through canonical grain-factory access patterns
  - map snapshot data to outgoing composers
- Do not query database contexts or repositories directly from packet handlers.
- Keep persistence access in grains/services/providers that own domain state.
- Do not use ad-hoc grain key strings in handlers when extension-based access exists.
- Do not add silent `catch` blocks in handlers.
- When snapshot fields are available, map them into composer payloads instead of TODO placeholders.
- For incoming message records in `Turbo.Primitives/Messages/Incoming/**`, keep mandatory fields explicit (use `required` where appropriate) instead of default-fallback contracts.

## Session and room routing constraints
- Connection/session lifecycle starts in gateway flow; do not duplicate session registration in handlers.
- Post-SSO session attachment goes through `PlayerPresenceGrain` (one active presence grain per player id).
- Player-targeted outbound flow must be:
  - resolve player presence grain
  - call `SendComposerAsync`
  - rely on presence fan-out to subscribed sessions
- Do not send directly to raw sockets/session transports from packet handlers.
- Active-room membership/discovery belongs to `RoomDirectoryGrain`; do not bypass it with ad-hoc room tracking.
- Grain lifetime remains Orleans-managed by default; use `[KeepAlive]` only for explicitly justified directory/manager grains.

## Task recipes

### Add packet handler
- Required context files:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `CONTEXT.md`
  - `Turbo.Primitives/Orleans/GrainFactoryExtensions.cs`
- Required references:
  - one handler in same domain under `Turbo.PacketHandlers/<Domain>/`
  - related incoming message type under `Turbo.Primitives/Messages/Incoming/**`
- Forbidden changes:
  - no direct DB access in handler
  - no direct session/socket sends
  - no ad-hoc grain key literals when extension methods exist
- Validation:
  - `dotnet build Turbo.Main/Turbo.Main.csproj -t:TurboCloudFastCheck`
  - `dotnet build Turbo.Main/Turbo.Main.csproj -t:TurboCloudQualityGate`

### Change grain behavior
- Required context files:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `CONTEXT.md`
  - target grain interface in `Turbo.Primitives/**/Grains/*.cs`
- Required references:
  - existing grain in same module
  - related snapshot/state types in `Turbo.Primitives/Orleans/Snapshots/**` or `States/**`
- Forbidden changes:
  - no handler-layer fallback logic that bypasses grain ownership
  - no lifecycle changes that abuse `[KeepAlive]` without infrastructure justification
- Validation:
  - `dotnet build Turbo.Main/Turbo.Main.csproj -t:TurboCloudFastCheck`
  - `dotnet build Turbo.Main/Turbo.Main.csproj -t:TurboCloudQualityGate`

### Add message/composer mapping
- Required context files:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `CONTEXT.md`
  - neighboring message/composer classes
- Required references:
  - incoming message under `Turbo.Primitives/Messages/Incoming/**`
  - outgoing composer under `Turbo.Primitives/Messages/Outgoing/**`
  - handler using same message family
- Forbidden changes:
  - no placeholder payload collections when source snapshot data exists
  - no implicit default-fallback contracts for mandatory incoming fields
- Validation:
  - `dotnet build Turbo.Main/Turbo.Main.csproj -t:TurboCloudFastCheck`
  - `dotnet build Turbo.Main/Turbo.Main.csproj -t:TurboCloudQualityGate`

### Refactor lookup/cache logic
- Required context files:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `CONTEXT.md`
  - current lookup owner grain/service
- Required references:
  - existing set/invalidate methods
  - all reverse-lookup call sites
- Forbidden changes:
  - no one-way cache updates; forward/reverse mappings must stay coherent
  - no loss of case-insensitive semantics for username lookups
- Validation:
  - `dotnet build Turbo.Main/Turbo.Main.csproj -t:TurboCloudFastCheck`
  - `dotnet build Turbo.Main/Turbo.Main.csproj -t:TurboCloudQualityGate`

## Required validation before completion
```bash
dotnet build Turbo.Main/Turbo.Main.csproj -t:TurboCloudFastCheck
dotnet build Turbo.Main/Turbo.Main.csproj -t:TurboCloudQualityGate
```

## Definition of done for AI changes
- All modified files match nearby patterns and contract rules.
- Quality gates pass with no new warnings introduced by the change.
- Architecture invariants for touched areas are explicitly confirmed in PR.
- Edge/failure behavior is addressed for logic changes.
- Any context-rule updates needed by the change are included in the same PR.

## PR expectations for AI-assisted work
- Disclose AI usage and major generated sections.
- Be able to explain complex generated logic in your own words.
- Include verification of at least one edge/failure scenario when behavior changes.
