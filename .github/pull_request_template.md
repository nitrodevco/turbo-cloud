## Summary
- Change:
- Why:

## Validation
- [ ] `dotnet build Turbo.Main/Turbo.Main.csproj -t:TurboCloudFastCheck`
- [ ] `dotnet build Turbo.Main/Turbo.Main.csproj -t:TurboCloudQualityGate`
- [ ] Failure/edge-case behavior was verified (when logic changed)

## Architecture checks (when relevant)
- [ ] Handlers stay orchestration-focused (no direct DB queries; no silent exception swallowing)
- [ ] Snapshot-to-composer mapping includes available fields (avoid placeholder payloads)
- [ ] Username/id lookup and cache changes preserve bidirectional, case-insensitive behavior
- [ ] Incoming message contracts keep mandatory fields explicit
- [ ] Player-targeted outbound flow uses `PlayerPresenceGrain.SendComposerAsync`
- [ ] Active-room tracking and keepalive behavior remains in `RoomDirectoryGrain`
- [ ] Any `[KeepAlive]` usage has a clear infrastructure reason
